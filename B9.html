            <b>This is the first item's accordion body.</b>  It is show by default,
            until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style
            each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the 
            showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with can 
            go within the <span class="item4">.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow.
